<h1>Term Project Proposal</h1>

<p>My website is going to be about what to do in Boston if someone is visiting for a few days. I will include
	my favorite places to eat, activities for during the day and break those down into activities for
	children vs. activities for adults, historical landmarks and what to do at night as well. The 
	objective of my website is to help people plan a visit to Boston and not have to do extensive searching 
	for things to do. I also think it will give me the opportunity to really think about what I enjoy
	most about Boston and narrow down my top 3 or 4 favorite things in each category I plan on using.
	This website is important because Boston is a popular city for tourists and while there is a lot
	of information about what to do in Boston on the internet already, I don't think many of them are
	from the perspective of a 21 year old. That being said, my target will be young adults who are
	looking to do more exciting things and not the "traditional" visit to Boston. I also think this
	website would be interesting for individuals who already live in Boston because they may
	be able to uncover new restaurants/bars/clubs through my website. I plan to include content on
	restaurants to go to, bars/clubs to go to, brunch spots and day time activities as well. I'm sure I'll
	also develop more ideas as I actually create my website. </p>
