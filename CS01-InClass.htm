	<p>I chose Babson because I knew I wanted to go to school for Business and with 
Babson's reputation, I knew it was a good choice. I also wanted a relatively small school 
because I came from a small high school and didn't want to be overwhelmed. In addition,
I didn't want to be too far from home and Babson is roughly 45 minutes from my hometown.</p>
   	<p>My favorite sport to watch is baseball. My great-grandfather pitched for the Red
Sox so I'm obligated to be a fan. My favorite activity would be dancing. I've danced
since I was 3 years old and I am a member of the Babson Dance Ensemble.</p>
